    "**Definition**: A process is an instance of a running program. It's the basic unit of execution in an operating system.\n",
    "**Key** **Characteristics**:  \n",
    "- Independent: Each process has its own isolated memory space, meaning one process cannot directly access the memory of another.\n",
    "- Resource Allocation: Each process is allocated its own set of resources (CPU time, memory, files).\n",
    "- Overhead: Creating and managing processes can have a higher overhead compared to threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Threads**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**: A thread is a smaller, lightweight unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads can exist within a single process.\n",
    "**Key** **Characteristics**:\n",
    "- Shared Resources: Threads within the same process share the same memory space, code, and data.\n",
    "- Lightweight: Creating and managing threads is generally faster and more efficient than creating and managing processes.\n",
    "- Concurrency: Threads allow a process to perform multiple tasks concurrently, making better use of CPU resources.\n",

    "1. **Process Creation**: When you execute a program like main.py, the operating system creates a new process for it. This process has its own memory space, resources, and a single thread of execution.\n",
    "2. **Main Thread:** This initial thread, often called the main thread, starts running the code in your program. It sequentially executes the lines of code in your script.\n",
    "3. **Multithreading** (Optional): If your program explicitly creates additional threads using libraries or language features designed for multithreading (e.g., threading module in Python), then the process will have multiple threads running concurrently.\n",
